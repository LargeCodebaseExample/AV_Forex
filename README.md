API and then clean/visualize/upload to ActivityInfo database.

    automatically scheduled on cron. The log files `forexETL.txt` is
    then used by the Command Center to … blah blah blah…

-   Plots of forex for the past week are saved in `/outputs` and then
    transported to \_\_\_ using \_\_\_\_ blah blah.
